### Spam filter
There are three ways to implement the spam filter: iterative, MinHash+LSH algorithm, Naive Bayes classifer.

### Network attack classifier
Network attack classifier using machine learning methods NSL-KDD dataset was used Data collected by tcpdump, 24 different types of attacks were recorded Attacks in the training set belong to 4 general categories
